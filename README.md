# weathermap
Task:
Create a responsive weather web application that works on both mobiles and desktop. The application should inform the user if today is a ‘nice’ weather day based on the user's settings. The user should be able to set the definition of a ‘nice’ day is with some predefined threshold values (e.g. temperature, humidity). The UI should contain at least one animation. The application should preferable use a Javascript MVC Framework (AngularJS, React, Vue, Backbone or something similar).
Step 1: Information on the actual weather information should be stored in a JSON file.
Step 2 (Optional): Information on the actual weather information can be retrieved from the open weather map's API:
